[Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/) is a research-driven technology investment firm. Our approach is flexible, long term, multi-stage, and global.
We often get involved at the earliest stages of formation and continue supporting our portfolio companies over time.

We take a deeply hands-on approach to help projects reach their full potential, from the technical (mechanism design, security, engineering) 
to the operational (recruiting, regulatory strategy).

This Github Organization hosts all of Paradigm's open source experiments, designs, and production-ready code.

Among other things, we are currently building:
* [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth): Modular, contributor-friendly and blazing-fast implementation of the Ethereum protocol, in Rust
* [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/): A fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
* [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/): High-performance, well-tested & documented libraries for interacting with Ethereum and other EVM-based chains, in Rust.
* [Artemis](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/artemis): A simple, modular, and fast framework for writing MEV bots in Rust.
* [Paradigm Data Portal](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/paradigm-data-portal): A collection of open source crypto datasets for researchers and tool builders
* [Flood](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/flood/): A load testing tool for benchmarking EVM nodes over RPC.
* [Flux](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/flux): A graph-based LLM power tool for exploring many completions in parallel.
* [Sinker](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/sinker): Middleware to synchronize Postgres to Elasticsearch

You can find our [research at the Paradigm website](https://www.paradigm.xyz/writing).

Other projects we support:
* [REVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/): A blazing-fast hookable Rust EVM by [Dragan Rakita](https://github.com/rakita)
* [Ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs): High quality, well-tested and documented low-level Ethereum utilities in Rust
* [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) ([Announcement](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/11/paradigm-and-wagmi)): A Javascript library for web3 frontends, which provides simple hooks (e.g. useBalance) for developers to interact with Ethereum, by [Tom Meagher](https://github.com/tmm/) and [Jake Moxey](https://github.com/jxom)
* [Viem](https://viem.sh): Lightweight, composable, and type-safe modules that interface with Ethereum, optimized for frontend developers, an alternative to web3.js and ethers.js
