[Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/) is an investment firm focused on supporting the crypto/Web3 companies and protocols of tomorrow. Our approach is flexible, long term, multi-stage, and global.
We often get involved at the earliest stages of formation and continue supporting our portfolio companies over time.

We take a deeply hands-on approach to help projects reach their full potential, from the technical (mechanism design, smart contract security, engineering) 
to the operational (recruiting, regulatory strategy).

This Github Organization hosts all of Paradigm's open source experiments, designs, and production-ready code.

You can find our [research at the Paradigm website](https://www.paradigm.xyz/writing).

* [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/): A fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
* [REVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/): A blazing-fast hookable Rust EVM by [Dragan Rakita](https://github.com/rakita)
